## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors, like the caret (^) and dollar sign ($), specify the start or end of a string. They help define word boundaries. Keep in mind that regex can vary between programming languages, so it's essential to refer to language-specific documentation. Quantifiers, such as *, +, and {3}, determine repetition
### Quantifiers
"Quantifiers in regex, such as ?, *, +, and {}, determine how many times something occurs. They can be eager or reluctant, depending on character placement. You can hover over parts of an expression to understand their purpose. For more details, W3Schools provides descriptions starting with 'matches any string with' or 'matches any string that' for quantifiers.
### OR Operator
 Alternation in regex uses the '|' symbol as a simple 'OR'. For example, to find 'a1,' 'b2,' or 'c3,' use 'a1|b2|c3
### Character Classes
Character classes, like A-Z or a-z, match any character within a specified range, such as all letters from A to Z or a to z, and it can apply to numbers too.
